                    <p>IPFS is awesome, but as an enthusiast I find it difficult to search for things. I started looking for a solution to this: a search engine for IPFS--but I couldn't find one. IPFS-Search was active for a while, but then shut down. And IPSE also shut down.<br><br>So, to scratch my own itch, I made a search engine for IPFS. It uses a Custom Google Search Engine (CGSE) to rank links in the IPFS.io public gateway. A hacky solution, but it's a start (and it works)! This entire project took about 2.5 hours and less than 1000 lines of code. I (the creator) am also 14 years old. <a href="https://timmymckeegan.com">Here's my personal website.</a><br><br>This project was written in vanilla HTML + CSS + Python with Flask.
